# React Instanews
# Summary
I reacted an old project i made while learning HTML, CSS and Javascript using React. The orignal project was a responsive single page website using Ajax, JSON, and API concepts. The site dynamically populates a grid of news stories from the NY Times website based on what topic the user selected in the drop down select box. 

# Languages and tools used:
* HTML
* CSS (animations)
* JavaScript
* React
* Redux
* Ajax/JSON
* Git/Github

# What did I learn?
During this project, I learned how to incorporate AJAX requests into React using Redux-Thunk. It was difficult to incorporate the requests in a clean way but looking at past projects for a concise example i think i have a decent solution.
The addition of React-Create-App made this project much easier to start and gave with it hotloading so i didnt need to manually refresh it.
